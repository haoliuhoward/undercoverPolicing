Replication Instructions

This folder contains all materials needed to replicate our results. You can find the replication codes in the *R* folder. Results can be replicated by either the *.R* code or the *.qmd* code. *.R* code will show all results in R while *.qmd* code will produce the results in a clean pdf. We recommend opening the *undercoverPolicing.Rproj* and run the code because doing so you won't be needing to set working directories.
